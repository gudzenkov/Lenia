        "Patterns and behaviors you see in the video above were produced by the artificial life system that we called ‚ÄúParticle Lenia‚Äù. It‚Äôs inspired by [Lenia Mathematical Lifeforms](https://chakazul.github.io/lenia.html), which in turn is a continuous generalization of John Conway's [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). In this article we are going to describe the motivation, implementation and behavior of Particle Lenia.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before diving into the details of the proposed model, we would like to speculate a little about why to create such models. Physics, chemistry and biology study the organization of matter at various scales, from subatomic to cosmic. The behavior of each scale is determined by the laws that govern behavior of the underlying scale, but the nature of relations between scales is full of surprises. For example let‚Äôs consider a simple idea: matter consists of tiny, constantly moving particles, which attract each other at close distances, but repel when they are too close. [Lennard-Jones potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennard-Jones_potential) is one of possible mathematical formalizations of the above idea. In spite of the apparent simplicity of microscopic dynamics, at large scales these rules give rise to a plethora of complex phenomena, such as aggregate states of matter, thermodynamics, acoustics, hydrodynamics and turbulence. In scientific and engineering practice we can often abstract microscopic details behind macroscopic models, such as diffusion or Navier-Stokes equations, that operate at the scale of interest. But in some domains, like material science or biochemistry, we have to focus on the relationship between many orders of magnitude in scale. How do changes in molecular structure reflect in macroscopic material properties? How do genomic sequences translate into morphological appearance? In the field of biology these ties between scales are especially important and obscure at the same time. That‚Äôs why development of practical methods of capturing and analyzing such relations are of a great need. *In silico* multi-agent models provide a computational playground for creation and improvement of such methods. We may use such models for efficient design of local microscopic rules that lead to a desired global behavior. Thus, creation of simulated Artificial Life serves as a stepping stone in deep understanding of life in the real world.\n",
        "\n",
        "[Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) cellular automata captivated the attention of a few generations of researchers and hobbyists with a diversity of complex behaviors stemming from a very simple set of local rules. A few continuous generalizations were proposed, [SmoothLife](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wDSQxmAyTw) and [Lenia](https://chakazul.github.io/lenia.html) are most popular among them. They describe evolution of one or a few scalar fields with a system of PDEs. Such models can support a great diversity of interesting and beautiful life-like behaviors. Yet we argue that PDE-based models have a couple of drawbacks, which motivated the creation of the particle based analogy."

Authors also propose a method of combining multiple update rules in the same space. Particle Lenia can be seen as another perspective on the Flow Lenia model: we represent moving matter as a population of particles, rather than a scalar field (see [Lagrangian flow vs. Eulerian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_and_Eulerian_specification_of_the_flow_field)).\n"

We think that the main contribution of this work is to provide a link between the popular Lenia model and particle systems. The proposed artificial life model demonstrates a large diversity of interesting and even beautiful behaviors, even in the case when all particles share the same parameters. We also examine the model dynamics through the lens of a greedy local energy minimization process, and compare the behavior of the model to that of running with an equivalent global energy minimization routine. We find that the difference in behavior between these paradigms is non-intuitive and may have significance for the design of future systems of optimized interacting agents.\n"

Particle positions define the configuration of the potential field, and the field affects the motion of particles, which accelerate towards the gradient of the potential field. Particle Lenia follows the same principle. In this section we are going to develop and implement Particle Lenia step by step, while contrasting it against the original Lenia model.\n",

        "Original Lenia is a PDE system, which means that in order to simulate it on a computer we have to discretize the space somehow. It was shown that Lenia creatures can exist on regular and even non-regular grids of various resolutions. Of course, discretization artifacts can't be completely neglected, for example some behaviors can't exist if the grid resolution is too low, while other behaviors may exploit the raster grid structure and exist at low resolutions only.\n",

        "In Particle Lenia, the number of particles can be seen as an analog to the grid resolution. In this section we try to see if it's possible to reproduce a specific pattern with a different number of particles. Consider a 200-particle \"rotor\" pattern we discovered in the previous section (third from left on the figure above). Let's apply following transformations to it:\n",

        "* Scale point coordinates and extent of the kernel $\\mathbf{K}$ by two: $\\mathbf{p}'_i = 2\\mathbf{p}_i, \\mu_K'=2\\mu_K, \\sigma_K'=2\\sigma_K$. It's easy to see that this transformation doesn't change the values of $\\mathbf{U}$ (and thus $\\mathbf{G}=G(\\mathbf{U})$) perceived by particles, but they are distributed much sparser now, so repulsion forces have weakened or vanished.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Replace each particle with four new ones to restore density and repulsion force. The previous step increased the area covered by the formation four times. Now we replace each particle with four new ones, distributed around the old particle position in a rotated cross fashion (similar to the [rotated grid super-sampling](https://blog.demofox.org/2015/04/23/4-rook-antialiasing-rgss/))\n",
        "\n",
        "* Fix the range of $\\mathbf{U}$. The previous step quadrupled the number of particles, which in turn made values of $\\mathbf{U}$ four times larger on average. To compensate, we may either set $w_K' = w_K/4$, or adjust $\\mu_G'=4\\mu_G, \\sigma_G'=4\\sigma_G$. We prefer to use the former method.\n",

Our model description closely follows terminology and notation used in original Lenia paper ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05433), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE46jKYcI4Y)). We would also like to mention the Lenia Expanded Universe ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03742), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT49wpyux-k)) and [Sensorimotor Lenia](https://developmentalsystems.org/sensorimotor-lenia/) articles, because they provide a clear path for future development of our work.\n",

        "**Energy-based models** The energy-based formulation of Particle Lenia is inspired by a number of classic models from physics and chemistry. [Lennard Jones potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennard-Jones_potential) is a classic example of a system that combines attractive and repulsive potential fields. Energy terms of the [Embedded Atom Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_atom_model) have even greater similarity to the Particle Lenia energy. The biggest difference of our model is the lack of momentum; the assumption that particles are effectively moving through a viscous substance that quickly dissipates kinetic energy. We also think it is worth mentioning [JAX MD](https://github.com/jax-md/jax-md) that implements a number of molecular models using JAX differentiable programing framework.\n",

This phenomena is often refered to as [emergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence), [self-organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organization) or [swarm intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence). [Boids](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/) model of flocking is a classic example from that category. There are plenty other interesting examples, such as [Primordial Particle Systems](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep37969) and [models](https://www.ventrella.com/Clusters) [based](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Kx4Y9TVMGg) based on non-reciprocal forces between different particle types. Other models try to mimic  pheromone signaling through the environment (e.g. [Physarum](https://cargocollective.com/sagejenson/physarum) model).\n",

This gives rise to behaviors that have dramatically different characteristics from global energy minimization. Recent work on [EigenGame](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/game-theory-as-an-engine-for-large-scale-data-analysis) provides an interesting example when local multi-agent optimization has a number of desirable traits in comparison to global optimization. These traits enable new ways of solving classic computational problems."

Another promising future work direction is goal driven search for patterns and rules capable of forming specific patterns or performing specific tasks, in the spirit of [Sensorimotor Lenia](https://developmentalsystems.org/sensorimotor-lenia/). We believe that these principles of particle swarm design can later be applied to real world self-organizing systems.\n",

The [introduction video](https://youtu.be/AP3zeHyWakw) demonstrates a number of creatures that were discovered, and can be explored in the supplementary [interactive demo](https://znah.net/lenia)\n",
